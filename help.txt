Hotkey format examples:
  Ctrl+Alt+Y
  Ctrl+Shift+X
  Alt+F2

Command formats:
- Sequential keys: seq:F11,F12      → Press F11 then F12
- Simultaneous keys: sim:F11,F12    → Press F11 and F12 together
- Type text: text:Hello world!      → Type "Hello world!"
- Run terminal command: cmd:gnome-terminal → Launch command
- Direct command: any bash command

Tips:
- Sequential keys are executed one after another
- Simultaneous keys are pressed and released together
- Delays can be added in seq using xdotool; example: seq:F11,sleep0.1,F12
- You can manually edit ~/.config/my_hotkeys.conf and run 'nass-keys apply'
- Comments in the config start with #
- Hotkeys must be pressed simultaneously (Ctrl+Alt+Key), sequences not supported natively
- To revert everything safely, use 'nass-keys revert'

Examples:
  nass-keys add "Ctrl+Alt+H" "cmd:xdg-open ~/Documents"
  nass-keys add "Ctrl+Alt+T" "cmd:gnome-terminal"
  nass-keys add "Ctrl+Alt+R" "seq:F11,F12"
  nass-keys add "Ctrl+Alt+Y" "sim:F11,F12"
  nass-keys add "Ctrl+Alt+U" "text:Hello world!"
